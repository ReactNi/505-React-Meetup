# 505 React Meetup
This group is for React and React Native developers in New Mexico. We meet once a month to talk about React, build projects, and help each other debug. This is where we post our code and meetup slides so you can follow along.

Stay up to date on our monthly meetings. The day of the week changes, but they are usually weekdays 6pm-8pm.

# Start your first React project today!
Use create-react-app and start building immediately. Check out our presentation slides from our first meetup to build a simple chat app. We will continue to build on this app at future meetups.
